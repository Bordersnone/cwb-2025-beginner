- ‚úÖ `push.bat` automation script for quick Git workflow
- ‚úÖ All accounts set up: GitHub, Render, etc.

### From Class 3: HTML Structure
- ‚úÖ Proper HTML5 document structure
- ‚úÖ Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`

## üìö Today's Class Structure

### Part 1: Verify Render Deployment (15-20 minutes)

Let's make sure everyone's deployment pipeline is working.

#### What to Check:
1. **GitHub Repository**
   - Go to your GitHub repo
   - Verify you have an `index.html` file
   - Make sure it has some HTML content

2. **Render Connection**
   - Log in to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Find your web service in the dashboard
   - Check that it's connected to your GitHub repository
   - Verify the branch is set to `main`

3. **Test Deployment**
   - Make a small change to your `index.html` (add a comment or change text)
   - Use one of these methods to deploy:
     - **Option A:** Run `push.bat` (Windows users)
     - **Option B:** Manual Git workflow:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Test deployment"
       git push origin main
       ```
   - Watch Render deploy automatically (check the "Events" tab)
   - Visit your live URL to see the change

### Part 2: Build Your "About Me" Page (30-40 minutes)

Time to create something you're proud of!

#### Required Elements:
Your "About Me" page must include:

### Part 3: Deploy and See It Live! (20-30 minutes)

This is where the magic happens!

#### Workflow Options:

**Option A: Using push.bat (Quick & Easy)**
1. Save your HTML file in VS Code (Ctrl+S)
2. Double-click `push.bat` or run it from terminal
3. Wait for Render to deploy (check the dashboard)
4. Visit your live URL!

**Option B: Manual Git Workflow (Understanding Each Step)**
1. Save your HTML file
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git status              # See what changed
   git add .              # Stage all changes
   git commit -m "Add complete About Me page"
   git push origin main   # Push to GitHub
   ```
4. Render automatically detects the push and deploys
5. Visit your live URL!

**Remember:** Each `git push` triggers a new deployment on Render automatically!

---

### Part 4: Mini-Challenge (If Time Permits)

Enhance your page with one of these:

1. **Add an image** - Your photo or something that represents you
2. **Add a table** - Show your skills, schedule, or favorites
3. **Add a video** - Embed a YouTube video you like
4. **Add a form** - Simple contact form (won't send yet, just practice)

**Ideas & Examples:** [mini-challenge.md](../01-most-common-tags/steps/mini-challenge.md)

---

## üè† Homework & Practice

### Required Practice

**1. Complete Your About Me Page**

If you didn't finish in class, complete all required elements:
- Proper structure
- Multiple sections
- Lists
- Links
- Personal content

**2. Practice the Full Workflow 3 Times**

Make three different small changes and deploy each one:

**Change 1:** Add a new section or paragraph
- Save ‚Üí `push.bat` (or Git workflow) ‚Üí Check live site

**Change 2:** Add an image or link
- Save ‚Üí `push.bat` (or Git workflow) ‚Üí Check live site

**Change 3:** Update your footer or add more interests
- Save ‚Üí `push.bat` (or Git workflow) ‚Üí Check live site

**3. Master Git Status Checking**

At each step of your workflow, check the status:

```bash
# After making changes (before adding)
git status

# After staging (before committing)
git add .
git status

# After committing (before pushing)
git commit -m "Your message"
git status

# After pushing
git push origin main
git status
```

Notice how the status changes at each step!

---

### Extra Credit (Optional)

**Challenge 1: Add All Three Enhancements**
- An image
- A table
- A video or form

**Challenge 2: Create a Multi-Page Site**
- Create a second page (`projects.html` or `contact.html`)
- Add navigation links between pages
- Deploy both pages

**Challenge 3: Experiment with VS Code Shortcuts**
- Practice using Ctrl+Arrow keys for navigation
- Use Tab/Shift+Tab for indentation
- Challenge yourself to code without using the mouse
