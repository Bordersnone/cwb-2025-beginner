# Class 5 - Build, Edit, and Publish Your First Page

**Lead:** Kiley  
**Assistant:** Timotej  
**Date:** October 7, 2025

## üìù What We Actually Covered

> **Note:** We adjusted our plans based on student needs! Instead of completing the full deployment + build workflow, we focused deeply on Git fundamentals to ensure everyone has a solid foundation.

### Git from the Ground Up

We discovered that some students weren't clear on Git commands, so we started from the very beginning and built up understanding piece by piece.

#### Understanding Git Commands & Syntax
- **Everything matters in code** - Spaces, capitalization, punctuation - it all matters!
- **Why spaces matter** - Discussed why `git add.` doesn't work but `git add .` does
- **Command structure** - Broke down how terminal commands are structured:
  - The main command (e.g., `git`)
  - A subcommand or action (e.g., `add`, `commit`)
  - Values/arguments that the command uses (e.g., `.`, `filename.html`)
  - A space between the command and the word to its right indicates that the word is either a subcommand or a value
- **Getting help** - Introduced the `-h` and `--help` flags for any command

#### What is a Repository?
- Used the **post office metaphor** to explain Git concepts
- A **repository is where you put your code** - like a post office is where mail is delivered to and picked up from
- **Git is the service** that helps you package and ship your code - just like the postal service provides packaging and shipping services
- **GitHub** is a company that provides a **remote** repository for you to store your code
- Historically, there have been all kinds of tools like Git, such as SVN, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase, but Git has become the most popular

#### The Git Workflow (Post Office Metaphor)

1. **`git init`** - Announcing you want to ship something
   - Like walking into a post office and saying "I have things to ship"
   - Initializes a new Git repository

2. **`git add`** - Packing boxes
   - Like choosing what items go into which boxes
   - We explored several variations:
     - `git add .` - Add ALL changes in the current directory
     - `git add filename.html` - Add a specific file
     - **What `.` means** - Current directory
     - **What `..` means** - Parent directory
     - **Why `git add.` fails** - No space between command and argument
   - Discussed that both `git add .` and `git add tuesday_git_example.html` can achieve the same result if there's only one change
   - **Selective staging** - Sometimes you DON'T want to add everything (e.g., `test_dont_share.html`, `timotej_bank_account.html`)
   - **Unstaging files** - What to do if you accidentally add a file you didn't mean to

3. **`git status`** - Checking what's ready
   - See what files have been changed
   - See what's been staged (_which is like seeing what's been put in the box_) and what has not
   - Super helpful for knowing where you are in the process

4. **`git commit`** - Taping up the box
   - Like sealing your package before shipping
   - Once taped, you can still modify it, but it's more complicated
   - **Importance of commit messages** - Labeling what's in the box

5. **Git Remotes & `origin`**
   - Explained what a "remote" is - the destination where you're shipping
   - **What is `origin`?** - The default name for your remote repository
   - You can have multiple remotes pointing to different places
   - Used `git remote` command to view configured remotes

6. **Branches (Brief Introduction)**
   - Discussed **branches and trunks** - the tree analogy
   - **History of Git** - Why branching matters for collaboration
   - **`main` vs `master`** - The naming change and why GitHub made it
   - **`origin/main`** - How your local `main` branch relates to GitHub's `main` branch
   - Briefly showed how to create and switch branches
   - **Note:** Emphasized this is an advanced concept - we'll focus on `main` for most of this course

7. **`git push origin main`** - Shipping the package
   - Pushed code to GitHub successfully!
   - Everything synced and ready for deployment

8. **`git log`** - Viewing history
   - Briefly showed how to see the history of commits
   - Like looking at a receipt of all the packages you've shipped

#### Terminal Navigation Basics

Since students are on different operating systems, we covered basic terminal navigation:
- **`ls`** (Mac/Linux) and **`dir`** (Windows) - List files in current directory
- **`cd`** - Change directory to navigate between folders
- Why these commands are important for working with Git

### Key Moments
- ‚úÖ Created a file called `tuesday_git_example.html` to practice
- ‚úÖ Intentionally staged/unstaged files to see what happens
- ‚úÖ Emphasized taking notes (2 out of 3 students took notes, 1 very detailed!)

### What We Skipped
We started confirming Render configurations but pivoted to focus on Git fundamentals when we discovered the knowledge gap. Most students had Render set up, but one hadn't connected her GitHub repository yet.

## üéØ Original Planned Goals

Below is what we originally planned to cover (for reference):

1. ~~**Confirm Render deployment**~~ - Partially started, will complete next class
2. ~~**Build your "About Me" HTML page**~~ - Postponed
3. **Practice the Git workflow** - ‚úÖ Covered in depth!
4. ~~**Complete a mini-challenge**~~ - Postponed
5. **Wrap-up and reflection** - ‚úÖ Completed

## üìö Class Structure (Original Plan)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand original lesson plan</summary>

### 1. Confirm Render Deployment

We'll start by making sure everyone's Render deployment is working correctly.

[‚Üí Render Deployment Check Guide](./steps/render-deployment-check.md)

### 2. Build Your "About Me" Page

Time to create your first complete web page! We'll build an "About Me" page that includes:

- A proper HTML5 structure
- Headings and paragraphs
- Lists of your interests or hobbies
- Links to your social media or projects
- At least one image

[‚Üí HTML About Page Guide](./steps/html-about-page.md)

### 3. Practice the Git Workflow

Learn the essential Git commands to save and publish your work:

- `git add` - Stage your changes
- `git commit` - Save your changes with a message
- `git push` - Publish your changes to GitHub

[‚Üí Git Workflow Guide](./steps/git-workflow.md)

### 4. Mini-Challenge

Once your About Me page is live, enhance it by adding one of the following:

- An embedded video
- A contact form
- A table with information about yourself

[‚Üí Mini-Challenge Guide](./steps/mini-challenge.md)

## üè† Homework & Practice

Practice what we learned in this class (Class #5)! Complete these exercises to reinforce your Git knowledge.

### Required Practice

**1. Practice Git Commands with a New File**

Create a new HTML file and practice the full Git workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create a new file
# Use VS Code or your text editor to create: practice_git.html

# 2. Stage your changes
git add practice_git.html

# 3. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add practice Git file"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**2. Experiment with Selective Staging**

Create multiple files and practice adding them selectively:

1. Create 3 new files: `file1.html`, `file2.html`, `file3.html`
2. Add only `file1.html` and `file2.html` to staging (not `file3.html`)
3. Check what's staged using `git status`
4. Commit the staged files
5. Then stage and commit `file3.html` separately

**3. Practice Using `git status`**

Get comfortable checking your repository status:

1. Create a new file in your repository
2. Run `git status` - what does it show?
3. Stage the file with `git add`
4. Run `git status` again - what changed?
5. Commit the file
6. Run `git status` one more time - what does it say now?

**4. Use the Help Flag**

Practice using the help documentation:

```bash
# Try these commands
git add --help
git commit -h
git status --help
```

Pick one command and write down 3 things you learned from the help documentation.

**5. Practice Terminal Navigation**

Get comfortable moving around in the terminal:

```bash
# List files in current directory
ls        # Mac/Linux
dir       # Windows

# See where you are
pwd       # Mac/Linux (print working directory)
cd        # Windows (with no arguments)

# Navigate to a folder
cd foldername

# Go up one level
cd ..
```

Practice navigating to your project folder using `cd`.

### Extra Credit (Optional)

**Challenge: Fix a Mistake**

1. Create a file called `secret.html`
2. Accidentally stage it with `git add .`
3. Figure out how to unstage it (use `git status` for hints!)
4. Delete the file
5. Stage and commit something else instead

**Exploration: View Your Commit History**

Try the `git log` command:

```bash
git log
```

What information does it show you? Can you identify:
- The commit message you wrote
- When the commit was made
- Who made the commit

**Advanced: Branch Basics (Optional)**

We briefly mentioned branches in class. If you're curious, look up what these commands do (but remember, we're focusing on `main` for this course):
- `git branch`
- `git branch <branch-name>`
- `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`

Write a few sentences about what you think branches are used for.
