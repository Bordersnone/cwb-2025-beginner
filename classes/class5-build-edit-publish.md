**Date:** October 7, 2025

## Overview

Today we put everything together! You'll confirm your deployment is working, build a complete "About Me" page, practice the full Git workflow, and tackle a mini-challenge to showcase your new skills.

## Goals

1. **Confirm Render deployment** - Verify your site is live and accessible
2. **Build your "About Me" HTML page** - Create a complete, well-structured personal page
3. **Practice the Git workflow** - Add, commit, and push your changes
4. **Complete a mini-challenge** - Add additional features to your page
5. **Wrap-up and reflection** - Review what we've learned

## Class Structure

### 1. Confirm Render Deployment

We'll start by making sure everyone's Render deployment is working correctly.

### 2. Build Your "About Me" Page

Time to create your first complete web page! We'll build an "About Me" page that includes:

- A proper HTML5 structure
- Headings and paragraphs
- Lists of your interests or hobbies
- Links to your social media or projects
- At least one image

[→ HTML About Page Guide](./steps/html-about-page.md)

### 3. Practice the Git Workflow

Learn the essential Git commands to save and publish your work:

- `git add` - Stage your changes
- `git commit` - Save your changes with a message
- `git push` - Publish your changes to GitHub

[→ Git Workflow Guide](./steps/git-workflow.md)

### 4. Mini-Challenge

Once your About Me page is live, enhance it by adding one of the following:

- An embedded video
- A contact form
- A table with information about yourself

[→ Mini-Challenge Guide](./steps/mini-challenge.md)

## Wrap-Up

By the end of this class, you should have:

- ✅ A working Render deployment
- ✅ A complete "About Me" HTML page
- ✅ Experience with the Git workflow
- ✅ A published web page you can share with others

## Next Steps

Keep experimenting! Try adding more pages, styling with CSS, or building something completely new.
