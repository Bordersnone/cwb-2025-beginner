# Borders:None Web Dev Curriculum

Welcome to the Borders:None web development class curriculum! This repository contains all the materials, guides, and examples for our hands-on web development course. Each class builds on the previous one, taking students from setup through building and publishing their first web pages.

> **üìÖ [View the full class schedule](../README.md#-class-schedule)** in the main repository README.

## How to Use This Curriculum

Each class page includes:
- **üìù Class Recap** - What we covered in class (including examples and metaphors used)
- **üè† Homework & Practice** - Exercises to practice at home
- **üìñ Resources** - Links for further learning
- **‚úÖ What You Should Know** - Learning objectives checklist
- **üîú Next Class** - Preview of what's coming

### Working with Guides and Materials

1. **Follow sequentially** - Classes build on each other, so go in order
2. **Copy and experiment** - Try the code examples in your own projects
3. **Read carefully** - Pay attention to explanations, not just code
4. **Ask questions** - If something isn't clear, reach out to instructors

Some classes include **detailed reference guides** (like the Git workflow guide in Class 5) that you can return to whenever you need a refresher.
