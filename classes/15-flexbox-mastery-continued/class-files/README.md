## 💡 Tips

**Learning from Examples:**
- Don't just copy - understand WHY each property is used
- Try removing or changing properties to see their effect
- Compare the Grid version (Class 13) to the Flexbox version (Class 15)

**Building Your Own:**
- Start with the HTML structure first
- Add basic Flexbox properties (`display: flex`, `flex-direction`)
- Then add alignment (`justify-content`, `align-items`)
- Finally add sizing and spacing (`flex`, `gap`)
- Style last (colors, fonts, etc.)

**Debugging:**
- Use browser DevTools to inspect flex containers
- Check if `display: flex` is applied to the parent
- Verify flex items are direct children of flex container
- Look for conflicting CSS (width on flex items, etc.)
