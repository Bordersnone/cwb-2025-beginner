## 📋 What Actually Happened

**Class Status:** This class was shortened to a status check and planning session.

**Context:** Some students who attended Class 13 are working on Flexbox exercises, while others missed that session and need to catch up. To ensure everyone moves forward together, we decided to reschedule the planned content.

**Decision:** Class 14's planned Flexbox mastery content will be covered in **Class 15 (Tuesday, November 11)** along with catch-up support for those who missed Class 13.

## 🎯 What This Means for You

### If You Attended Class 13:
✅ Great! You're on track. Continue working on converting the grid examples to Flexbox layouts.

**Practice Assignment:**
- Work on converting `example1.html`, `example2.html`, and `example3.html` from [Class 13](../13-flexbox-practice-fundamentals/class-files/) to use Flexbox instead of Grid
- The goal: Make them look exactly the same but using Flexbox
- **Important:** You'll need to modify the HTML structure, not just the CSS (Flexbox requires different structure than Grid)

### If You Missed Class 13:
📚 Don't worry! Class 15 will include catch-up time.

**What to do before Tuesday:**
1. Review the [Class 13 materials](../13-flexbox-practice-fundamentals/README.md)
2. Try to understand the difference between Grid and Flexbox
3. Attempt the example conversions on your own (it's okay if you get stuck!)
4. Bring questions to Class 15

## 📂 Materials to Review

> **📁 [Class 13 Example Files](../13-flexbox-practice-fundamentals/class-files/)**
>
> Focus on these grid-based layouts to convert to Flexbox:
> - **`example1.html`** (with `style.css`) - Photo gallery layout
> - **`example2.html`** (with `style2.css`) - Card layout
> - **`example3.html`** (with `style3.css`) - Navigation layout
>
> **Note:** Ignore the task files (task1.html, task2.html, etc.) - those were created by mistake.

## 🏠 Practice Assignment for Everyone

### Required: Convert Grid Examples to Flexbox

**Challenge:** Take the three grid-based examples from Class 13 and recreate them using Flexbox.

**Files to Convert:**
1. `example1.html` + `style.css`
2. `example2.html` + `style2.css`
3. `example3.html` + `style3.css`

**Requirements:**
- Visual appearance should look identical to the original
- Must use Flexbox (`display: flex`) instead of Grid (`display: grid`)
- Will need to modify HTML structure (Flexbox needs different structure than Grid)
- Create new files so you keep the originals for reference

**How to Approach:**
1. Copy the example file (e.g., save as `example1-flexbox.html`)
2. Look at the current Grid CSS and identify what layout it creates
3. Plan how to achieve the same layout with Flexbox
4. Modify both HTML structure and CSS as needed
5. Test by resizing browser to ensure it's responsive

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each

**Grid (what the examples currently use):**
- Best for 2D layouts (rows AND columns)
- Can place items precisely in cells
- Use: Page layouts, photo galleries, complex grids

**Flexbox (what you're converting to):**
- Best for 1D layouts (one direction at a time)
- Items flow in a line and wrap if needed
- Use: Navigation bars, card rows, alignment

### Why Change the HTML Structure?

**Grid approach:**
```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
</div>
```

**Flexbox might need:**
- Different nesting levels
- Additional wrapper elements
- Different semantic structure

The key: Grid can define both rows and columns at the parent level. Flexbox works in one direction, so you might need nested containers for complex layouts.
