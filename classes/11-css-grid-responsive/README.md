# Class 11 - CANCELED

**Original Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **CANCELED DUE TO LOW ATTENDANCE**

---

## What Happened

Class 11 was canceled because only one student attended. Instead of conducting the full planned lesson on CSS Grid and Responsive Design, a one-on-one support session was held to review CSS fundamentals.

---

## Content Rescheduled

The CSS Grid and Responsive Design content originally prepared for this class has been **rescheduled for Class 13** (November 4, 2025).

**Why the delay?**  
Class 12 was dedicated to reinforcing CSS fundamentals to ensure all students have a solid foundation before tackling advanced layout topics like CSS Grid.
