## 🎯 Class Overview

This class completes what wasn't finished in Class 7 due to time constraints:
1. Practice the Git deployment workflow multiple times
2. Build a complete "About Me" HTML page with proper structure
3. Introduction to CSS basics (what it is, where to put it, basic styling)
4. Deploy the styled page to Render

---

## 📺 Key Feature: Embedded Video Tutorials

Since this is a video class and students may have slow internet connections at home, each major section includes:
- **Direct YouTube links** to short, highly-rated beginner tutorials
- **Written step-by-step instructions** so students can follow along without video if needed
- **Code examples** they can copy/paste if they get stuck

All videos were curated for:
- ✅ Clear explanations for beginners
- ✅ Good reviews and view counts
- ✅ Appropriate length (5-15 minutes typically)
- ✅ Professional production quality

---

## 📚 Additional Resources Created

### Video Tutorial Library
A comprehensive resource was created at `/resources/video-tutorials.md` containing:
- Categorized video tutorials (HTML, CSS, Git, etc.)
- Duration and description for each video
- Recommendations for which videos to watch for each class
- Tips for learning from videos effectively

**This resource can be used across all classes going forward!**

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

Students should complete this class able to:
- Execute the full Git workflow confidently (status → add → commit → push)
- Build a properly structured HTML page with semantic elements
- Understand what CSS is and the three ways to add it
- Style a page with internal CSS (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Deploy changes to Render and see them live

---

## 💡 Teaching Notes

### Context from Class 7:
- Students got Git author details configured ✅
- Students got Render connected to GitHub ✅
- Class ended 45 minutes early
- No time for deployment practice ❌
- No time for CSS introduction ❌

### This Class Should:
- Focus heavily on practicing the workflow
- Go slowly through CSS basics
- Celebrate each deployment success
- Remind students they can take their time
- Point to video resources frequently

## 🚨 Known Challenges

Based on the course so far, students may struggle with:
1. **Git workflow confusion** - They need repetition
2. **CSS syntax** - Forgetting semicolons, curly braces
3. **Patience** - They want to rush but need to go slow
4. **Troubleshooting** - Not reading error messages
5. **Confidence** - Comparing themselves to others

The materials address these by:
- Repeating the workflow 3+ times
- Showing every character to type for CSS
- Adding "take your time" reminders throughout
- Including troubleshooting sections
- Adding encouraging messages

---

## 📋 Homework Assigned

Students are asked to:
1. Complete their styled About Me page if not finished
2. Practice the deployment workflow 2 more times
3. Personalize their CSS (change colors, fonts, spacing)

**Optional challenges** include:
- Adding more CSS properties
- Creating a second page
- Making it mobile-responsive

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Students are successful if they:
- Have a live About Me page on Render
- That page includes proper HTML structure
- That page has at least basic CSS styling
- They understand the Git workflow (even with a cheat sheet)
- They feel proud of what they built

**It's okay if not everything is perfect!** The goal is progress and confidence building.

## 🎉 Special Notes

This class structure is different from previous classes:
- **More self-paced** due to video format
- **More YouTube resources** since Timotej teaches alone
- **More written detail** since students may have slow connections
- **More encouraging language** since students work independently

The goal is to ensure students can succeed even with:
- Slow internet (they have written instructions)
- Confusion during video (they have YouTube alternatives)
- Working alone (they have step-by-step guidance)
- Language barriers (simple, clear language used)

**This class was designed with care to meet students where they are and give them multiple paths to success!** 🚀
